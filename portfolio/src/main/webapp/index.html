    <h3>About Me</h3>
      <img src="images/niklus.jpg" align="left" style="margin: 0px 30px 0px 0px;width:200px;height:260px;border:5px double black"/>
      <p>Hello, I'm Nicholas! I enjoy basketball, mountain biking, and reading. 
         My family is originally from Serbia, but have since moved to Vancouver, BC. 
         Growing up I competed in many sports, like Hockey, Track and Field, and Basketball, and I find that their team
         aspects helped shape who I am today.
      </p>
      <p>Nowadays, I study Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia and spend my free time weightlifting,
         playing video games, taking long walks on the beach with my dog, and relaxing with my cat.
      </p>

      <p>I also spend much of my time designing, constucting, and flying RC aircraft. I utilize this hobby with my school's
         Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) design team, where we build large scale quadcopters for industrial uses.
      </p>
